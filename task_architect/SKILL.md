# Task Architect Skill

This skill transforms vague project goals into concrete technical specifications and executable task lists.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Ensure every project has a clear **Specification (`SPEC.md`)**.
- Break down complex features into **Micro-tasks (`TASKS.md`)**.
- Provide a clear progress metric for the central Dashboard.

## 🚀 Commands & Workflows
- `/plan [Goal]`: Full planning cycle (SPEC.md + TASKS.md).
- `/next`: Execute next task.

## 📂 File Structure
- `SPEC.md`: Requirements & Architecture.
- `TASKS.md`: Checkbox list of tasks.
